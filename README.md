# Cup of Java
This app was made following the tutorial by Ashwin Joy from *Pythonista Planet* [found here.](https://pythonistaplanet.com/to-do-list-app-using-django/?expand_article=1) using Django and Python.

## Description

This is a barebones Python webapp to manage to do items. I intend on making it more elaborate and adding features as a way to learn Django.
## Setup
Before installing, ensure you have `pip`, `git`, and `python3`. To run the server yourself, follow these commands:

Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jwizzlejosh/djangotodo.git
```
Download the Requirements
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Migrate (*For Windows, use `python` instead of `python3`*)
```bash
python3 manage.py migrate
```

Run Server
```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```
